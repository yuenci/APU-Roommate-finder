# About This Project

Our product is a platform that connects students who have empty rooms with those who are in need of a place to rent. It helps them easily solve their housing problems without having to rely on messaging on social media platforms and waiting for a suitable place to come up. With our product, finding a place to stay is made easier and more convenient. We hope to help students in APU to find a place to stay and to make their lives easier.
